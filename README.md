Getting Started
Prerequisites: You will need Java installed on your system.
Compile and Run:
Download the source code files.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the source files.
Compile the code using a Java compiler (e.g., javac LibraryManagementSystem.java).
Run the application using java LibraryManagementSystem.
Code Structure
The code is organized into several classes:

Book: Represents a book object with attributes like title, author, etc.
Student: Represents a student user with attributes like name, email, etc.
LibraryManagementSystem: Main class that initializes the application and manages the user interface.
SplashScreen: Displays a splash screen with application name and logo (optional).
LoginPanel: Handles user login with username and password.
RegisterPanel: Allows users to register for a new account (Student or Teacher).
DashboardPanel: Main dashboard with tabbed panels based on the user role.

Dashboard: Logged-in users see a dashboard with relevant options.
Admins have an additional "Student Data" tab to manage students.
Users can access functionalities like browsing books, borrowing/returning books, etc., through different tabs.
Note: This is a basic overview of the code functionality. Specific details of each panel's functionalities are not included in this README.

Customization and Future Enhancements
This code provides a foundation for a library management system. You can customize it further by:

Implementing detailed functionalities for each panel (e.g., searching books, managing student data).
Adding functionalities for Teacher role (if applicable).
Integrating with a database for persistent data storage.
Enhancing the user interface design.
This is a starting point for building a comprehensive library management system. Feel free to explore the code and adapt it to your specific requirements.
